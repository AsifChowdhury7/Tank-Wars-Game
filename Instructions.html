    tank will have three lives in each map before being eliminated. Once a tank runs out of lives, the next map will
    appear until the third and final map is reached.</p>

  <h4>Map 1</h4>

  <p>In Map One, there will be walls, just like the other maps. However, there will be obstacles placed
    inside the walls that the tank will not be able to pass through.Try to shoot your opponent 5 times to win the round.
  </p>


  <h4>Map 2</h4>

  <p>In Map Two, similar to the first map, there will be boundaries and walls in place. Health power-ups will now be
    available. The five lives rule will still apply.
  </p>

  <h4>Map 3</h4>

  <p>Map three is the last map. This will be very similar to map two. There will be a cool new map!
